# Nitro
Nitro is a self project to understand working of Swift. 
The application consists of a DashBoard which shows the current weather and has Option for Shopping List and Food Planner for the week. 
This is unlike other Food planner where the user can type in what ever they want. Current Support Target it 9.3 that helps using those old iPads that one may deem useless. It is a nice add on for the Kitchen. 

The Project is now Public as everyone can benifit from it and maybe make it better. Its has a good base for a start.
